The zxamy is based on a neuronal network and implements a large number of neuronal nodes. The network platform simulates the basic thinking mode of the human brain, and realizes calculation, evaluation, feature identification, qualitative, computational reconstruction, evaluation, decision-making, internal testing and scheme selection in the neuron cell. And concentric and coordination between neurons.
